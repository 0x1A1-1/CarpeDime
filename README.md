# CarpeDime
CarpeDime is a chrome extension that promotes students' self awareness of the amount of money they're spending to attend college.

The extension reads in students' Google calendar under permission and tuition paid to provide unit price of class. The extension enables whenever a student is visiting a site that he shouldn't be in class and then displays how much money is wasted every second when the student is on a site he shouldn't be on.

The server is running on Node.js and client side is Chrome extension.
